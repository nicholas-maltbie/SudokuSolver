# SudokuSolver
Our instructor for Data Structures challenges us to fix the class's program to 
solve Sudoku puzzles.

For the lab, the project needed to be written in both python and c++. The 
objective is to write a program that can solve sudoku puzzles. 

To opearte the project, create a text file to represent a sudoku puzzle in the 
same format as sudoku7.txt. The numbers are in a 9x9 grid and an 'x' represents 
a location that is empty. Run the python code or complie the c++ code and 
execute the output. The program will prompt for the name of the file containing 
the sudoku puzzle and then will procede to solve the puzzle. 

While solivng the puzzle, the project will output its progress toward the 
solution. Once the puzzle has been solved, the program will terminate and the 
last screen will be the solution or an incomplete puzzle if the program could 
not find a solution.

## Different Programs

* sudoku6.py solves the puzzles using python
* SudokuNick.cpp solves the puzzle using c++
* a.out the copiled version of sudokuNick.cpp*
